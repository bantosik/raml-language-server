A Language Server for RAML that exposes smart RAML language support for various IDEs
using the Language Server protocol standard (https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol).

(Work in Progress)

# Architecture

This project exposes the [RAML 1.0 JS parser](https://github.com/raml-org/raml-js-parser-2)
as a [Language Server](https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol) using this [SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-languageserver-node).

It will be available via NPM and at the central Language Server registry.
